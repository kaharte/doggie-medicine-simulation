# doggie-medicine-simulation

This is a little program that simulates the amount of half and whole tabs in my
dog Charlie's bottle of folic acid. He gets a half tab every day. I pick one tablet
out of the container, and if it is already cut in half I give it to him as is,
otherwise, I cut it in half and put the other half back in the bottle. I'm
assuming the half and whole tablets are evenly distributed through the bottle
